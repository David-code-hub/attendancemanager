# Attendance Manager
Hey, started this project to make attendance tracking for Zoom classes a breeze. You can create sessions, manage lists, and mark off attendees in real-time. Super handy for reporting to supervisors and keeping classes on track! 🚀

> Has to be decoupled and codebase has to be updated with best practices! Feel free to make a pr🏋️‍♀️
